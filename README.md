## EmguCVDemoJmalino

This is a basic level project to explore the Emgu CV library. This project creates a shape matcher. It was done to prepare for Jolly-Snowman. 

### Project Development

In this initial deployment it functions as a shape matcher, using a stop sign template. Later developments will allow for uploading of a personal template. 

#### Potential Direction

Eventially this matching could be used as the base function for a First Response pregnancy test reader app (Clone).
