## EmguCVDemoJmalino

This is a basic level project to explore OpenCV (known as Emgu) library in C#. It was done to prepare for the Jolly Snowman Project.

### Project Development

In the initial deployment this programs functions as a shape matcher, using a stop sign template. Later updates allowed for uploading of a custom template into the shape matcher.
Additionally functionality was added to create a pregnancy test reader function when uploading an image. This functionality still needs refinements, but does work given a test that matches the strip template. Later updates will allow users to chose their brand or type of test for reading. 

#### Potential Direction

Eventually this matching could be used as the base function for a pregnancy test reader app (First Response App Clone).
